The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict whether a loan applicant is likely to default on their loan. Loan default prediction is a critical task for financial institutions, as it helps minimize credit risk and improve decision-making during the loan approval process.

Using a dataset that includes applicant information such as credit history, income, employment type, loan purpose, and more, we preprocess the data and apply a Random Forest Classifier to classify each application as either default (1) or non-default (0). The model is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and a confusion matrix.

This predictive model can be integrated into financial systems to support risk-based lending decisions, improve operational efficiency, and reduce loan delinquency rates.
